## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (LTS version) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo Go App**: You will need the Expo Go app on your physical Android or iOS device, or an Android Emulator set up on your computer.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Adityakumar1323/Glow-cart-app.git](https://github.com/Adityakumar1323/Glow-cart-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd Glow-cart-app
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages**
    This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**
    This command will start the Metro bundler. The `-c` flag is recommended to clear the cache on first run.
    ```bash
    npx expo start -c
    ```

### Running the App

1.  **On a physical device**: Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with the Expo Go app on your phone.
2.  **On an Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal after the server has started.

## üïí Time Taken

- **Initial Setup & Component Library**: ~2 hours
- **Screen Development & Navigation**: ~3 hours
- **State Management & API Integration**: ~2 hours
- **Debugging & Refinements**: ~4 hours
- **Total Estimated Time**: ~11 hours

## üìù Assumptions & Known Issues

- **API**: The app currently uses the `dummyjson.com` API for product data. This is a mock API, so the data is not real and will not persist.
- **Authentication**: The Login and Register screens are for UI purposes only and do not have a real authentication backend connected.
- **No Payment Gateway**: The checkout process is a placeholder and does not integrate with a real payment system.
- **Expo Go Version**: This project was built and tested with Expo SDK 51. Ensure you are using a compatible version of the Expo Go app on your device/emulator.
